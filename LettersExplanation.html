                    <h2>What is MBTI?</h2>
                    <p>The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is one of the most widely used personality frameworks in
                        the world. 
                        It is designed to help individuals understand their preferences in how they perceive
                        the world and make decisions. Developed by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs
                        Myers, the MBTI is based on Carl Jung's theories of psychological types. By categorizing people
                        into 16 personality types, it offers valuable insights into human behavior, relationships, and
                        personal development.</p>

                    <h2>How Does MBTI Work?</h2>
                    <p>The MBTI divides personality into four dichotomies, or pairs of traits, that represent opposite
                        preferences. These are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Extraversion (E) vs. Introversion (I):</strong> How individuals direct their energy
                            and attention—toward the external world or inwardly toward thoughts and ideas.</li>
                        <li><strong>Sensing (S) vs. Intuition (N):</strong> How individuals prefer to gather
                            information—focusing on details and facts versus patterns and possibilities.</li>
                        <li><strong>Thinking (T) vs. Feeling (F):</strong> How individuals make decisions—based on logic
                            and consistency versus values and emotions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Judging (J) vs. Perceiving (P):</strong> How individuals approach life—favoring
                            structure and planning versus flexibility and spontaneity.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="intro-block">
                    <h2>What Can MBTI Be Used For?</h2>
                    <p>MBTI is a versatile tool with applications in various aspects of life, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Self-Understanding:</strong> Gain insights into your strengths, weaknesses, and
                            preferences to foster personal growth.</li>
                        <li><strong>Career Guidance:</strong> Identify career paths that align with your personality
                            traits and work style.</li>
                        <li><strong>Team Collaboration:</strong> Enhance communication and teamwork by understanding
                            different personality types in group settings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Improve interpersonal relationships by recognizing and
                            appreciating the differences in others' approaches and preferences.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>While MBTI is a powerful tool, it's important to note that it does not define an individual's
                        full potential or predict future behavior. Instead, it serves as a starting point for deeper
                        self-reflection and understanding.</p>
